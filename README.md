Lizard Game : Solution by using algorithms like Breadth-first search (BFS) - Depth-first search (DFS) - Simulated annealing (SA).
The game is to find a place in the mentioned n*n board to put each baby lizard.
However, there is a catch, the baby lizards have very long tongues. A baby lizard can shoot out its tongue and eat any other baby lizard.
For each baby lizard, you can place them in one spot on a grid. From there, they can shoot out their tongue up, down, left, right and diagonally as well. 
Your lizards cannot shoot their tongues through the trees nor can you move a lizard into the same place as a tree. As such, a tree will block any lizard from eating another lizard if it is in the path. Additionally, the tree will block you from moving the lizard to that location.
The program finds solution to a board consisting of trees using algorithms like:
BFS.
DFS.
Simulated Annealing.
